          PureGreen is a popular national smoothie and health food chain with a
          website, but no mobile application. How might we create an app for
          PureGreen that makes on-the-go ordering easier for users and aligns
          with the current brand's identity?

          <h1 className={`flex-1 `}>But Why?</h1>

        <p className={`w-full`}>
          Many PureGreens are located in populous towns and are bound to attract
          health-conscious busybodies. Being able to order ahead of time is
          important for the audience that PureGreen is marketed towards and
          having an app would also help maintain customer loyalty through a
          highly competitive landscape of food and drink options.
