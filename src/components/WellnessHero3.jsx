          We decided on creating an{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">AI assistant</span> that
          will help with all of the issues we found in our research including
          time management, accessibility, and healthcare. As AI is becoming
          increasingly prominent in our world and personal lives, we thought a
          chatbot was the most effective solution to being able to answer more
          specific questions from the user and addressed our problem statement.

          well as any feedback they had about using the prototype.

          being blue, but we changed it to pink and white to simplify the
          design. We also changed our info boxes and buttons to match throughout
          the app, as there were different styles of the same element across
          multiple screens. This helps the user{' '}

          Looking back, this project has given me a strong grasp of how users
          and apps interact. Guided by established design heuristics, I was able
          to design an app to help people learn and integrate healthier habits
          into their lives. Testing our prototypes with users trying out
          different tasks was invaluable - they pointed out things we hadn't
          even considered, allowing us to improve our design before even really
          starting. I would have liked to test our high-fidelity mockups as well
          if time allowed, however my team and I were still able to create a
          design we can really be proud of.
