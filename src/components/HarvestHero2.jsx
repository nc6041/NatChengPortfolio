          To kick off this project each team member started by coming up with a
          set of interview questions that we would later ask to customers inside
          the store to better understand the demographic of customers and how
          they have interacted with food and drink ordering apps before.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-6 w-full`}>
          We asked typical demographic questions like occupation, age, location
          on campus, etc. Some additional questions we asked related more to
          previous experience with apps such as, "What are the factors that
          influence your decision to order in person or mobile?" or "Walk me
          through your process of making a mobile order". Questions like these
          provided us with valuable information and understanding of PureGreen's
          typical customers and what they might look for in a mobile app.

            Key Insights

        </div>

        <p className={`mb-3 ml-3 text-malibu-300 w-full`}>
          1. <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">Convenience</span>:
          People like apps because it's easier to view on mobile on the go
          versus opening a website that has been built mainly for desktop.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-3 ml-3 text-malibu-300 mb-3 w-full`}>
          2. <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">Lifestyle</span>: Many
          customers are busy people who want something quick to get them through
          the day, but even waiting in the store for the smoothie to be made
          sometimes took up too much time. Additionally, we found it was also
          important to customers the ingredients and macronutrients of an item,
          and they would often compare these things before making a decision.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-3 ml-3 text-malibu-300 mb-6 w-full`}>
          3. <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">Familiarity</span>:
          Using a mobile app for ordering allows people to see their order
          history as well as deals and new items that would not be immediately
          obvious through the website or unavailable if ordering in person.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-32 w-full`}>
          After deriving these insights, we created user personas and user
          journey maps to further explore the minds of our potential users and
          identify highlights and pain points they might experience while
          engaging with the app.

        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          We created four{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">user personas</span> to
          help us visualize our target audience, including basic demographic
          information as well as a short bio, their core needs, and frustrations
          with other apps and ordering in person. We took each persona's needs
          into account, but ultimately focused in on one persona, Suzie, to base
          the rest of our flows on.

          After drafting our personas, we created{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">user journey maps</span>{' '}
          for each of them to track their feelings throughout the possible app
          ordering process. Our journey map stages consisted of the sections
          awareness & needs, consideration, acquisition, and service & loyalty.
          For each stage we noted the steps, thoughts, actions, pain points and
          feelings, and opportunities for growth in the app.

          Using our insights and notes from personas and journey maps we started
          a timed <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">sketching</span>{' '}
          exercise to visuzlize possible solutions for our app. The short time
          span allowed us to get our ideas on paper without worrying about
          nitty-gritty details and helped us think about bigger picture ideas.
          To narrow things down, each classmate taped their sketches for their
          respective apps to a wall and we were given the opportunity to
          participate in{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold ">dot voting</span> to pick
          our favorite sketches.

          <h1 className={`flex-1 `}>Wireframing</h1>
        </div>

        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          Following the sketching, we moved into the{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold">wireframing</span> phase
          to generate even more ideas. Over the span of a few classes, each team
          member was given 45 minutes to develop about eight low-fidelity
          wireframes for 3 screens: the dashboard, menu, and checkout pages.
          After creating these wireframe sets, we would consolidate as a team
          and narrow down the designs we liked best, as well as design any other
          necessary screens for the task of placing an order.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          The following image shows the wireframes we narrowed down togethers
          from our sets. The first row, from left to right, contains a splash
          screen, two dashboard options, and one menu screen. The second row
          contains the second menu option, two checkout/order placed options,
          and an order completed screen.
        </p>
        <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col pb-10 lg:px-20 pt-4 mb-24">

          <h1 className={`flex-1 `}>Continuing Wireframes</h1>
        </div>

        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          After narrowing down our options, we polished these wireframes and
          created new{' '}
          <span className="text-malibu-300 font-bold">
            high-fidelity wireframes
          </span>
          . We also added new screens like product detail pages as well as
          implementing small styles like buttons and fonts. Additionally, we
          created overlay screens such as "item added" overlays to implement
          feedback to the user when they add an item, giving them confirmation
          instead of leaving them wondering if they added an item or not. Our
          most important features from the wireframes lie in the dashboard,
          menu, and item detail pages.
        </p>
        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          The dashboard has hero shots and would contain different specials,
          announcements, and more, so that a user can easily see these things
          right when they open the app. The menu page allows users to expand
          each item into a card containing more nutrition facts and details
          about an item to minimize the time it takes to navigate to an item
          page, back out, and to another item page to compare ingredients and
          nutrition. The item detail page contains expandable information that
          goes much more in depth into the item. It has a full item description,
          an expandable ingredient list, an expandable customizations list with
          toggle switches, and another expandable extended information section.
          This way the user only needs to see exactly what they want and can pry
          further if necessary.

          To start the prototyping stage, we began by implementing a style guide
          with colors and type. We chose typefaces that mimicked the ones on
          PureGreen's site and logo. The colors also were taken from their
          website to promote brand identity and familiarity between the website
          and app. We finished off the prototypes by creating linkages and
          animations to turn our designs into a{' '}

          This project was a more unique process for me, as the team dynamic was
          slightly different than I have experienced before. The class is
          targeted towards graphic designers, so my team members did not have
          previous exposure to user experience design or Figma. Therefore, this
          case study had a bit of a learning curve for all of us. I guided the
          team through our different exercises and taught them how to use Figma.
          Each of the team members came with different skills, so it was up to
          me to delegate tasks that best fit each of them. I was privileged to
          be on a team with quick learners, as we were able to finish each step
          of the design process in a timely manner without too much difficulty.
        </p>

        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          The more difficult part of the process for me was trying to coordinate
          four different design styles into one. As shown in the wireframes, we
          each have vastly different design styles, so when we were splitting up
          the final designs, we had to go through and make small changes to make
          sure the end designs were all cohesive and matched the original
          PureGreen style.
        </p>
        <p className={`mb-10 w-full`}>
          In the end, this project was extremely valuable, as it taught me
          collaborative skills such as team leading and communication that I
          haven't had the opportunity to pick up in other projects. If we had
          more time, I would definitely like to test the app with more people or
          even ask PureGreen about the app and further consolidate with them.
