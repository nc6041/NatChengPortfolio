          In efforts to gain real world experience in design and working in a
          team, I searched for volunteer design opportunities to develop these
          skills while also making an impact on the community. I found an
          organization called benefit.design that assists non-profits with their{' '}
          <span className="font-bold text-malibu-300">creative needs</span>{' '}
          using the help of volunteer designers. The project I joined was a{' '}
          <span className="font-bold text-malibu-300">website redesign</span>{' '}
          for the non-profit educa11y, an organization dedicated to the{' '}
          <span className="font-bold text-malibu-300">
            advocation and education of digital accessibility
          </span>
          . Our team was split into web designers and brand designers.
          Unfortunately, after we made the wireframes, my team ceased all
          communication, so I was unable to produce any mockups with them, but I
          will still describe the design process up to where we stopped.
